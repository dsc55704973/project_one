An Analysis of Energy Companies: Financial Data & Stock Trends
By By Holly Shirmenzagas, Daniel Carrillo, & Daniel Jackson

Welcome to our analysis of the energy market!  Here you will find a snapshot into how the energy sector has been behaving, particularly during the economic turbulance of COVID.  This analysis is currently subject to further development and has been submitted as a team project to the Data Analytics Bootcamp at the University of Denver.

Here you will find a demonstration of how we worked as a team to leverage the power of git, APIs, matplotlib, pandas/Python, Numpy, data visualizations, and more, to effectively present empirical results with real-world impacts!

We set out to conduct our analysis of select energy companies using two major sources: Alpha Vantage (https://www.alphavantage.co) and Robin Hood (https://robintrack.net), and we thank these service providers tremendously!  Alpha Vantage is a manageable API that we knew could leverage to pull relevant financial information that we would need to execute our analysis, including Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow information.  With Robin Hood, we had access to tremendous hourly stock data, including price and holdings.

We invite you to take a look at our work!  Thank you for visiting!
